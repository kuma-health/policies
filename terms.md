## About Kuma

Kuma Health offers a digital platform designed to empower individuals to monitor and understand the relationship between their symptoms, activities, biometric data, biomarkers, and other personalized factors. We primarily provide a complimentary basic service alongside premium subscription options that deliver enhanced features and capabilities.

**NOT MEDICAL ADVICE:**

By using Kuma Health's services, you acknowledge that the platform serves as a digital tool aimed at assisting you in identifying factors that may impact your health positively or negatively and to monitor the long-term progression of your health conditions. It is your responsibility to decide how to act on your health based on the insights provided by our service. Therefore, you agree that Kuma Health is not a medical institution and does not offer medical advice.

The guidance and materials available through our Service and website (www.kumahealth.com) are for general informational purposes only. They are not meant to be relied upon as a replacement for professional medical advice tailored to your individual health needs. PLEASE DO NOT USE KUMA HEALTH FOR URGENT MEDICAL NEEDS. IF YOU EXPERIENCE HEALTH ISSUES, SEEK ADVICE FROM A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL.

Kuma Health's Service can be utilized in the following ways: (i) access contingent upon creating an account, whereby data is stored both locally on your device and on our servers, enabling use across multiple devices (the "Online Service"), and (ii) access contingent upon creating an account and subscribing to our fee-based premium services (the "Subscription Service").

## Creating an Account

For access to our premium features via our Subscription Service, registration and the creation of a personal account ("the Account") are required.
The registration process requires your explicit consent to this Agreement, including all documents incorporated by reference. Registration is considered complete once you confirm your email address or connect to the app via your Google or Apple account.

**Scope of Application:** These limitations apply equally to any liability claims against our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and third-party service providers.

Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you to their full extent.
